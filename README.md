# Exploring Twitter Data

This tutorial provides some basic techniques for exploring your Twitter dataset collected with either the `twitter-search`, `twitter-stream`, or `twitter-user` tasks in MassMine.

Drawing on the `twitter-explore.R` script, and the accompanying classroom demonstration, your goal is to complete the goals below with your own Twitter dataset. 

Goals:
- Reduce and compare data
- Rename variables
- Explore various categories of data:
  - Top retweeted users
  - Top retweeted URLs
  - Users with most followers
- Plot overall tweeting activity for each day
- Optional:
  - Map locations in your data using ggmap's `geocode()` function
